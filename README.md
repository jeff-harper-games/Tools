Dialogue System
Added a dialogue system that I am using for another project. It is inspired and modified from a Brackeys tutorial.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nRzoTzeyxU&t=1s)

There is a lot of things that I added to it to make it fit more of my style of programming. For example, I used ScriptableObjects to store my dialogue, so that it is easy to update and could be done without ever needing to go into a certain scene. Another things, that I am using in this system is TextAssets to pull lines of dialogue. This is nice because I can write my dialogue in a program like Microsoft word, which allows for spell check.
